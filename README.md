# 📷 Diffusion Model for Image Enhancement
![image alt]()

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

🌟 Overview

This project explores the use of Diffusion Models for Image Enhancement, leveraging deep generative modeling to improve image quality. Diffusion models work by progressively refining noisy images through a learned denoising process. This approach is effective for denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, and general image restoration tasks

✨ Key Features
1.  Diffusion-Based Image Enhancement: Uses probabilistic modeling to generate high-quality enhanced images.

2.  Denoising & Super-Resolution: Improves image clarity by reducing noise and increasing resolution.

3.  Deep Learning with PyTorch: Implements diffusion models using PyTorch and supports GPU acceleration for fast processing.

4.  Customizable Model Parameters: Users can adjust noise levels, training steps, and architecture for better performance.

5.  Supports Pretrained Models: Allows loading and fine-tuning existing models for specific tasks.

#   🔧 Installation

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Diffusion_Model_for_ImageEnhancement.git

    cd Diffusion_Model_for_ImageEnhancement
   

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Or manually install the key libraries:

    pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib tqdm pillow

3️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook    
Start Jupyter Notebook and open the file: 

    jupyter notebook Diffusion_Model_for_ImageEnhancement.ipynb

Then execute the cells to:
-   Load the dataset

-   Train the diffusion model

-   Generate and visualize enhanced images

🎯 Usage Guide

1️⃣ Data Preparation

Place input images in the data/ folder. The notebook automatically loads and preprocesses images.

2️⃣ Training the Diffusion Model

Adjust hyperparameters such as:

-   Noise Levels (amount of diffusion steps)

-   Model Architecture (number of layers, channels)

-   Batch Size & Learning Rate

Start training by running the training cells in the notebook.

3️⃣ Image Enhancement & Results

After training, the model will generate enhanced images, which are saved in the results/ folder.

📊 Model Details

🔍 How Does It Work?

1.  Forward Diffusion Process

-   Noise is gradually added to an image over multiple steps, following a Gaussian distribution.

2.  Reverse Process (Denoising)

-   The model learns to reconstruct the original clean image by removing noise step by step.

🏗 Model Architecture

The diffusion model follows a U-Net-based architecture with attention mechanisms for better feature learning.

🚀 Performance & Benchmarks

The model can be evaluated using:

✔ PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) - Measures image quality improvement.

✔ SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) - Assesses perceptual similarity between input and output images.

The notebook includes code to compute these metrics.

📌 Future Improvements

🔹 Support for larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet, DIV2K)

🔹 Implement Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for faster inference

🔹 Add interactive UI for real-time image enhancement
